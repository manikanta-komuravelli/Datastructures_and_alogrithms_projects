Unscramble Computer Science Problems

** Task0.py **
Time Complexity: O(1)
Analysis: No impact of input on run time


** Task1.py **
Time Complexity: O(n)
Analysis: As there are two lists, and they are looped through once each. Since, they are not nested loops, the complexity is O(n)


** Task2.py **
Time Complexity: O(n)
Analysis: Main List is looped through once, hence O(n)


** Task3.py **
Time Complexity: O(n log n)
Analysis: O(n) complexity for the For loop and O(n log(n)) for the Quick sort (https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/), as we are considering the more
dominant Big-O notation (O(n log n) > O(n)), the time complexity for this task would be O (n logn)

** Task4.py **
Time Complexity: O(n log n)
Analysis: O(n) complexity for the For loop and O(n log(n)) for the Quick sort (https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/), as we are considering the more
dominant Big-O notation (O(n log n) > O(n)), the time complexity for this task would be O (n logn)
